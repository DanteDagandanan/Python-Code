a machine learning model that trains and evaluates three different models (Random Forest, AutoKeras and Support Vector Machines) on a dataset. The goal is to find the model that performs the best on predicting the "Gross weight (kg)" target variable.

First, the code imports necessary libraries, such as pandas for data handling, sklearn for model training and evaluation, and numpy for numerical calculations. Then, it loads the dataset into a Pandas dataframe and removes any rows containing null values.

Next, the code sets up the data for model training by defining the features and target variables (X and y, respectively). The data is split into a training set and a validation set using the train_test_split function.

The first model trained is a Random Forest regressor. The code defines a parameter grid for the Random Forest model and performs hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV. The best estimator is used to predict values on the validation set, and the RMSE and R2 score are calculated and printed to the console. Feature importances are also calculated and plotted using a bar chart.

The second model is an AutoKeras regressor. The code initializes the AutoKeras regressor and fits it to the training data. It then evaluates the model on the validation set and prints the RMSE and R2 score. The model's predictions on the validation set are also stored for later comparison.

The final model is a Support Vector Machine regressor. The code defines a parameter grid for the SVM model and performs hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV. The best estimator is used to predict values on the validation set, and the RMSE and R2 score are calculated and printed to the console.

Overall, the code trains and evaluates three models using different algorithms and evaluates their performance on a dataset.
